# Whateverly: Mod 2

## Description
XCO is an app designed for users to choose a hiking trail or campground based on a location or nearest city they want to go to. A user can select whether they prefer to go camping or hiking they can search a specific category relevant to either of those (ie. camping would be type of camping). 

## Features
* Favorite a campground or favorite a trail
* Select whether they have visited a campground or trail
* Remove a specific card with information from the DOM
* Filter with relevant information for that dataset
* Search by nearest city

## Learning Goals
The main learning goals of this project was to begin learning how to use React, testing with Jest/Enzyme and be able to create a functional app using React and JSX together. 

## Our Successes
Our group encountered many successes, challenges, and quite a list of features we would like to add in the future (see our issues for more information on github). Each member of our project just recently learned about React so our skill level was the same going into the project. 

## Our Challeneges
One of our biggest challenges was creating a dynamic filter for several search options for both camping and hiking.

## Technologies Used

### Appended Cards

### Issues

* Space between cards and user input is too wide
* More button is disfunctional (should show assiciated camping/hiking suggestions)
* Needs a arrow down button to direct user to look below for results
* Favorite and Visited buttons need more instructions (what are they and what does the user do with them)
* Favorite and Visited buttons are disfunctional

The task was to build a tool to help fellow codering students practice a coding concept. This app displays code snippets of common syntax and/or logic mistakes in the following languages/libraries: HTML, CSS, JS, JSX, SCSS, REACT. The user selects the correct answer and gains points. The next iternation of this app will save all incorrect questions so users can revisit them and pratice them later and allow users to choose their prefered practice coding language.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Tools Used

HTML
